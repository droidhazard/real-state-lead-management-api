## 🎯 **Project Scope (I am Building)**

I am building a **secure, scalable backend API** that allows real estate agents or agencies to:

- Collect and store buyer/seller inquiries (leads)
- View, manage, and delete these leads securely
- Receive notifications when a new lead is submitted
- Export lead data for business use
- Authenticate access to the lead database (admin-only)

> This will be a **RESTful API** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, with secure admin login and optional deployment.

## 📌 **Use Cases**

### 🏠 1. **Lead Capture From Website Form**

- A potential buyer fills out a contact form on a real estate website
- Data (name, phone, property interest, budget, etc.) is sent to I can API
- The API securely stores it in the database

---

### 👀 2. **Admin Views All Leads**

- The real estate agent logs in securely
- They fetch a list of all leads, sorted by time, property type, or location
- They can click on any lead to see full details

---

### 🗑 3. **Delete a Lead**

- Admin can delete a lead (e.g., spam or irrelevant entry)

---

### 🔐 4. **Secure Authentication**

- Admin logs in using email/password
- Gets a **JWT token** to access protected endpoints
- Without a token, all admin routes are blocked

---

### 📧 5. **Email Notification (Optional)**

- Each time a new lead is submitted, the agent receives an email summary

---

### 📤 6. **Export Leads as CSV (Optional)**

- Agent can export all stored leads in `.csv` format for CRM or analysis

---

### 📈 7. **Integration Ready**

- Can be connected to a basic frontend (like a React contact form)
- Can later be expanded to connect with tools like **Zapier**, **Google Sheets**, **WhatsApp**, etc.

---

## 🚀 Bonus Value:

I can later sell this as:

- A **backend-only microservice**
- A part of a **custom lead management dashboard**
- A plug-and-play backend for any real estate website
